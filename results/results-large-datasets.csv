"An Interim Flood Protection Measures (IFPM) system is located in the roadway and/or sidewalk on this location. IFPMs are managed by NYC Emergency Management (NYCEM). IFPMs include permanent pre-installed or just-in-time components that are installed only in the event of an imminent coastal storm emergency, or for planned system testing purposes. Both component types may be located at grade and/or above grade. Prior to mobilizing, Permittees must contact NYCEM at IFPM@oem.nyc.gov for further instructions. If a coastal storm emergency develops after approved work starts, permittees shall follow any directives from NYCEM to shut down work, backfill excavations and remove or relocate equipment and materials within 24 hours if the work impedes IFPM installation.
