### Additional Data Related to Flood Risk
| Dataset | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| [Building Elevation and Subgrade (BES)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Building-Elevation-and-Subgrade-BES-/bsin-59hv) | The Building Elevation and Subgrade data contains New York City building centroids derived from the Department of Building's (DOB) February 26th, 2022 building footprint dataset. Each record contains a grade and first floor measurement for each building (recorded as feet above sea-level in the NADV88 vertical datum) and indicates if subgrade space exists. DCP contracted with an external data vendor to generate a single point, or centroid, that represented the location of the center of every building recorded in the DOB dataset. The dataset excluded the footprints of small accessory buildings such as sheds. Each row within the dataset represents one building centroid, and records the X and Y coordinates of that centroid in the NAD 1983 coordinate system. |
| [DEP Green Infrastructure](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/DEP-Green-Infrastructure/spjh-pz7h) | NYC Green Infrastructure Program initiatives. Green infrastructure (GI) collects stormwater from streets, sidewalks, and other hard surfaces before it can enter the sewer system or cause local flooding. The GI practice data contained in this dataset includes the location, program area, status, and type of GI.
Please visit nyc.gov/dep/gimap to view the DEP Green Infrastructure Map. |
| [311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) | All 311 Service Requests from 2010 to present. This information is automatically updated daily. One of the descriptors is Street Flooding. |
| [1 foot Digital Elevation Model (DEM)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/1-foot-Digital-Elevation-Model-DEM-/dpc8-z3jc) | NYC 1foot Digital Elevation Model: A bare-earth, hydro-flattened, digital-elevation surface model derived from 2010 Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. Surface models are raster representations derived by interpolating the LiDAR point data to produce a seamless gridded elevation data set. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a surface model generated from the LiDAR returns that correspond to the ground with all buildings, trees and other above ground features removed. The cell values represent the elevation of the ground relative to sea level. The DEM was generated by interpolating the LiDAR ground points to create a 1 foot resolution seamless surface. Cell values correspond to the ground elevation value (feet) above sea level. A proprietary approach to surface model generation was developed that reduced spurious elevation values in areas where there were no LiDAR returns, primarily beneath buildings and over water. This was combined with a detailed manual QA/QC process, with emphasis on accurate representation of docks and bare-earth within 2000ft of the water bodies surrounding each of the five boroughs.

| [DEP's Citywide Parcel-Based Impervious Area GIS Study](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DEP-s-Citywide-Parcel-Based-Impervious-Area-GIS-St/uex9-rfq8) | NOTE: This file includes data for all 5 boroughs and has a size of 4.60 GB. Individual borough files are available for download from the metadata attachments section. Citywide Geographic Information System (GIS) land cover layer that displays land cover classification, plus pervious and impervious area and percentage at the parcel level, separated into 5 geodatabases, one per borough. DEP hosted a webinar on this study on June 23, 2020. A recording of the webinar, plus a PDF of the webinar presentation, accompany this dataset and are available for download. Please direct questions and comments to DEP at imperviousmap@dep.nyc.gov. This citywide parcel-level impervious area GIS layer was developed by the City of New York to support stormwater-related planning, and is provided solely for informational purposes. The accuracy of the data should be independently verified for any other purpose.
