# Introduction
This project compiles freely accessible flood data from NYC Open Data and conducts an analysis based on datasets with the highest downloads and page views. The methodology and outcomes are documented in the [analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-flood-data/blob/main/analysis.ipynb) notebook, emphasizing the use of open-source and reproducible workflows. For specific flood-related information within datasets like 311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present, Emergency Response Incidents, NYCEM Emergency Notifications, Incidents Responded to by Fire Companies, and Street Construction Permits, refer to the [searchstring-flood.ipynb](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-flood-data/blob/main/searchstring-flood.ipynb) notebook.

The flood datasets are categorized into two groups:

- **Flood Hazard Layers:** Typically provided as shapefiles, examples include stormwater flood maps, Sandy inundation zones, hurricane evacuation zones, etc.
- **Additional Data Related to Flooding:** These datasets are somewhat related to flooding and/or flood risk information, encompassing 311 street flooding complaints, green infrastructure projects, Hazard Mitigation Plan projects, etc.

Explore tables detailing download counts and page views per dataset below, followed by a comprehensive inventory of flood datasets available on NYC Open Data.

## Flood-Related Datasets
| Dataset | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| [Hurricane Evacuation Zones](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Hurricane-Evacuation-Zones/uihr-hn7s) | Hurricane Evacuation Zones are determined by New York City Emergency Management and represent varying threat levels of coastal flooding resulting from storm surge. Hurricane evacuation zones should not be confused with flood insurance risk zones, which are designated by FEMA and available in the form of Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). |
| [Hurricane Evacuation Centers](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Hurricane-Evacuation-Centers/p5md-weyf/about_data) | This dataset shows hurricane evacuation centers. Persons requiring shelter during a hurricane are processed at a hurricane evacuation center and then transported to a hurricane shelter. In the event of a hurricane, the status of these hurricane evacuation centers should be confirmed at www.nyc.gov or by calling 311. |
| [Hurricane Evacuation Centers (Map)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Hurricane-Evacuation-Centers-Map-/ayer-cga7) | Hurricane Evacuation Centers Map. See above. |
| [New York City's Flood Vulnerability Index](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/New-York-City-s-Flood-Vulnerability-Index/mrjc-v9pm) | The Flood Vulnerability Index (FVI) assesses the distribution of vulnerability to flooding across NYC in order to guide flood resilience policies and programs. Vulnerability contains three components: exposure to a hazard, susceptibility to harm from the exposure, and capacity to recover (Cutter et al., 2009). There are six hazard-specific FVIs, one for each of the six different flood hazard scenarios, which include current and two future storm surge scenarios and current and two future tidal flooding scenarios. Exposures vary for different types of flooding and different scenarios within each flood type. |
| [New York City's Flood Vulnerability Index Map](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/New-York-City-s-Flood-Vulnerability-Index-Map/4vym-qrg3) | The Flood Vulnerability Index (FVI) Map. See above. |
| [DEP Green Infrastructure](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/DEP-Green-Infrastructure/spjh-pz7h) | NYC Green Infrastructure Program initiatives. Green infrastructure (GI) collects stormwater from streets, sidewalks, and other hard surfaces before it can enter the sewer system or cause local flooding. The GI practice data contained in this dataset includes the location, program area, status, and type of GI. |
| [Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Municipal-Separate-Storm-Sewer-System-MS4-Data/j57c-rqtq/about_data) | New York City’s Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Stormwater Management Program is a multiagency effort led by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to reduce pollution in stormwater runoff in the MS4 Area of NYC. This MS4 Map represents the known MS4 outfalls and drainage areas as of August 1, 2020 and provides additional data relevant to the MS4 Permit. The MS4 map only shows areas draining to the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System. DEP also maintains combined sewer and sanitary sewer systems; these service area delineations are not represented on this map. |
| [Building Elevation and Subgrade (BES)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Building-Elevation-and-Subgrade-BES-/bsin-59hv) | The Building Elevation and Subgrade data contains New York City building centroids derived from the Department of Building's (DOB) February 26th, 2022 building footprint dataset. Each record contains a grade and first floor measurement for each building (recorded as feet above sea-level in the NADV88 vertical datum) and indicates if subgrade space exists. DCP contracted with an external data vendor to generate a single point, or centroid, that represented the location of the center of every building recorded in the DOB dataset. The dataset excluded the footprints of small accessory buildings such as sheds. Each row within the dataset represents one building centroid, and records the X and Y coordinates of that centroid in the NAD 1983 coordinate system. |
| [Building Elevation and Subgrade (BES) - Map](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Building-Elevation-and-Subgrade-BES-Map/nmzg-6q5g) | The Building Elevation and Subgrade Map. See above. |
| [Hazard Mitigation Plan - Mitigation Actions Database](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Hazard-Mitigation-Plan-Mitigation-Actions-Database/veqt-eu3t) | New York City’s comprehensive effort to reduce or eliminate potential losses from the hazards described in the Hazard Specific section of the website. The map includes existing and completed mitigation actions that will minimize the effects of a hazard event on New York City’s population, economy, property, building stock, and infrastructure. It is the result of a coordinated effort by 46 New York City agencies and partners to develop and implement a broad range of inventive and effective ways to mitigate hazards. |
| [Hazard Mitigation Plan – Mitigation Actions Database (points)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Hazard-Mitigation-Plan-Mitigation-Actions-Database/t7k8-wj6b) | New York City’s comprehensive effort to reduce or eliminate potential losses from the hazards described in the Hazard Specific section of the website.

| [1 foot Digital Elevation Model (DEM)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/1-foot-Digital-Elevation-Model-DEM-/dpc8-z3jc) | NYC 1foot Digital Elevation Model: A bare-earth, hydro-flattened, digital-elevation surface model derived from 2010 Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. Surface models are raster representations derived by interpolating the LiDAR point data to produce a seamless gridded elevation data set. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a surface model generated from the LiDAR returns that correspond to the ground with all buildings, trees and other above ground features removed. The cell values represent the elevation of the ground relative to sea level. The DEM was generated by interpolating the LiDAR ground points to create a 1 foot resolution seamless surface. Cell values correspond to the ground elevation value (feet) above sea level. A proprietary approach to surface model generation was developed that reduced spurious elevation values in areas where there were no LiDAR returns, primarily beneath buildings and over water. This was combined with a detailed manual QA/QC process, with emphasis on accurate representation of docks and bare-earth within 2000ft of the water bodies surrounding each of the five boroughs. |

| [Land Cover Raster Data (2017) – 6in Resolution](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Land-Cover-Raster-Data-2017-6in-Resolution/he6d-2qns) | A 6-in resolution 8-class land cover dataset derived from the 2017 Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data capture. This dataset was developed as part of an updated urban tree canopy assessment and therefore represents a ''top-down" mapping perspective in which tree canopy overhanging features is assigned to the tree canopy class. The eight land cover classes mapped were: (1) Tree Canopy, (2) Grass\Shrubs, (3) Bare Soil, (4) Water, (5) Buildings, (6) Roads, (7) Other Impervious, and (8) Railroads. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2017 LiDAR (1-ft post spacing) and 2016 4-band orthoimagery (0.5-ft resolution). |
| [Topobathymetric LiDAR Data (2017)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Topobathymetric-LiDAR-Data-2017-/7sc8-jtbz/about_data) | Topographic and bathymetric LiDAR data was collected for New York City in 2017. Topographic data was collected for the entire city, plus an additional 100 meter buffer, using a Leica ALS80 sensor equipped to capture at least 8 pulse/m2. Dates of capture for topographic data were between 05/03/2017 and 05/17/2017 during 50% leaf-off conditions. Bathymetric data was collected in select areas of the city (where bathymetric data capture was expected) using a Riegl VQ-880-G sensor equipped to capture approximately 15 pulses/m2 (1.5 Secchi depths). |

| [Incidents Responded to by Fire Companies](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Incidents-Responded-to-by-Fire-Companies/tm6d-hbzd/about_data) | This dataset contains detailed information on incidents handled by FDNY Fire (non-EMS) units and includes fire, medical and non-fire emergencies. The data is collected in the New York Fire Incident Reporting System (NYFIRS), which is structured by the FDNY to provide data to the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS). NFIRS is a modular all-incident reporting system designed by the U.S. Fire Administration. After responding to an incident, FDNY officers complete one or more of the NFIRS modules, depending upon the type of incident. The information in these modules describes the kind of incident responded to, where it occurred, the resources used to mitigate it. Although NFIRS was designed specifically to understand the nature and causes of fire, as well as civilian fire casualties and firefighter injuries, it has been expanded to collect basic information on all incidents to which fire units respond. |
