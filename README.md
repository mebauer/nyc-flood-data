# Introduction
This project compiles freely accessible flood data from NYC Open Data and conducts an analysis based on datasets with the highest downloads and page views. The methodology and outcomes are documented in the [analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-flood-data/blob/main/analysis.ipynb) notebook, emphasizing the use of open-source and reproducible workflows. For specific flood-related information within datasets like 311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present, Emergency Response Incidents, NYCEM Emergency Notifications, Incidents Responded to by Fire Companies, and Street Construction Permits, refer to the [searchstring-flood.ipynb](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-flood-data/blob/main/searchstring-flood.ipynb) notebook.

The flood datasets are categorized into two groups:

- **Flood Hazard Layers:** Typically provided as shapefiles, examples include stormwater flood maps, Sandy inundation zones, hurricane evacuation zones, etc.
- **Additional Data Related to Flooding:** These datasets are somewhat related to flooding and/or flood risk information, encompassing 311 street flooding complaints, green infrastructure projects, Hazard Mitigation Plan projects, etc.

Explore tables detailing download counts and page views per dataset below, followed by a comprehensive inventory of flood datasets available on NYC Open Data.

| [Building Elevation and Subgrade (BES)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Building-Elevation-and-Subgrade-BES-/bsin-59hv) | The Building Elevation and Subgrade data contains New York City building centroids derived from the Department of Building's (DOB) February 26th, 2022 building footprint dataset. Each record contains a grade and first floor measurement for each building (recorded as feet above sea-level in the NADV88 vertical datum) and indicates if subgrade space exists. DCP contracted with an external data vendor to generate a single point, or centroid, that represented the location of the center of every building recorded in the DOB dataset. The dataset excluded the footprints of small accessory buildings such as sheds. Each row within the dataset represents one building centroid, and records the X and Y coordinates of that centroid in the NAD 1983 coordinate system. |
| [DEP Green Infrastructure](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/DEP-Green-Infrastructure/spjh-pz7h) | NYC Green Infrastructure Program initiatives. Green infrastructure (GI) collects stormwater from streets, sidewalks, and other hard surfaces before it can enter the sewer system or cause local flooding.

| [Hurricane Evacuation Centers](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Hurricane-Evacuation-Centers/p5md-weyf) | This dataset shows hurricane evacuation centers. Persons requiring shelter during a hurricane are processed at a hurricane evacuation center and then transported to a hurricane shelter. In the event of a hurricane, the status of these hurricane evacuation centers should be confirmed at www.nyc.gov or by calling 311. |
| [Hurricane Evacuation Centers (Map)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Hurricane-Evacuation-Centers-Map-/ayer-cga7) | This dataset shows hurricane evacuation centers. Persons requiring shelter during a hurricane are processed at a hurricane evacuation center and then transported to a hurricane shelter. In the event of a hurricane, the status of these hurricane evacuation centers should be confirmed at www.nyc.gov or by calling 311. |
| [Hurricane Inundation by Evacuation Zone (Map)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Hurricane-Inundation-by-Evacuation-Zone-Map-/2234-9r2y) | These inundation areas are based on the National Hurricane Center’s 2020 SLOSH (Sea Lake and Overland Surge from Hurricanes) Model for the NE1 basin post-processed to a 10 meter resolution. The data used assumes that the storm surge will occur at high tide. The Storm surge inundation data then used to develop New York City’s Hurricane Evacuation Zones. |
| [1 foot Digital Elevation Model (DEM)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/1-foot-Digital-Elevation-Model-DEM-/dpc8-z3jc) | NYC 1foot Digital Elevation Model: A bare-earth, hydro-flattened, digital-elevation surface model derived from 2010 Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. Surface models are raster representations derived by interpolating the LiDAR point data to produce a seamless gridded elevation data set. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a surface model generated from the LiDAR returns that correspond to the ground with all buildings, trees and other above ground features removed. The cell values represent the elevation of the ground relative to sea level. The DEM was generated by interpolating the LiDAR ground points to create a 1 foot resolution seamless surface. Cell values correspond to the ground elevation value (feet) above sea level. A proprietary approach to surface model generation was developed that reduced spurious elevation values in areas where there were no LiDAR returns, primarily beneath buildings and over water. This was combined with a detailed manual QA/QC process, with emphasis on accurate representation of docks and bare-earth within 2000ft of the water bodies surrounding each of the five boroughs. |

DEP hosted a webinar on this study on June 23, 2020. A recording of the webinar, plus a PDF of the webinar presentation, accompany this dataset and are available for download. This citywide parcel-level impervious area GIS layer was developed by the City of New York to support stormwater-related planning, and is provided solely for informational purposes. The accuracy of the data should be independently verified for any other purpose. |
| [Land Cover Raster Data (2017) – 6in Resolution](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Land-Cover-Raster-Data-2017-6in-Resolution/he6d-2qns) | A 6-in resolution 8-class land cover dataset derived from the 2017 Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data capture. This dataset was developed as part of an updated urban tree canopy assessment and therefore represents a ''top-down" mapping perspective in which tree canopy overhanging features is assigned to the tree canopy class. The eight land cover classes mapped were: (1) Tree Canopy, (2) Grass\Shrubs, (3) Bare Soil, (4) Water, (5) Buildings, (6) Roads, (7) Other Impervious, and (8) Railroads. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2017 LiDAR (1-ft post spacing) and 2016 4-band orthoimagery (0.5-ft resolution). |
| [311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) | All 311 Service Requests from 2010 to present. This information is automatically updated daily. One of the descriptors is Street Flooding. |
| [Emergency Response Incidents](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Emergency-Response-Incidents/pasr-j7fb) | Type and address of emergency incident to which OEM responded |
| [NYCEM Emergency Notifications](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYCEM-Emergency-Notifications/8vv7-7wx3) | Messages sent with information about emergency events and important City services. |
| [Incidents Responded to by Fire Companies](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Incidents-Responded-to-by-Fire-Companies/tm6d-hbzd) | This dataset contains detailed information on incidents handled by FDNY Fire (non-EMS) units and includes fire, medical and non-fire emergencies. The data is collected in the New York Fire Incident Reporting System (NYFIRS), which is structured by the FDNY to provide data to the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS). NFIRS is a modular all-incident reporting system designed by the U.S. Fire Administration. After responding to an incident, FDNY officers complete one or more of the NFIRS modules, depending upon the type of incident. The information in these modules describes the kind of incident responded to, where it occurred, the resources used to mitigate it. Although NFIRS was designed specifically to understand the nature and causes of fire, as well as civilian fire casualties and firefighter injuries, it has been expanded to collect basic information on all incidents to which fire units respond. |
