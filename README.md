# Introduction
This project has three primary goals:

1) Provide the most comprehensive catalog ever of flood-related datasets from NYC Open Data
2) To search for new flood-related datasets
3) Analyze popular flood-related datasets from NYC Open Data

First, I analyzed the datasets with the highest download counts and page views to understand which flood-related resources are most in demand for research and policy-making. The methodology and findings of this analysis are documented in the [metadata-analysis](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-flood-data/blob/main/notebooks/metadata-analysis.ipynb) notebook, focusing on open-source and reproducible workflows. While some of these statistics can be influenced, they may still provide valuable insights into dataset usage and interest.

Second, and I suspect the most exciting part, I conducted an extensive search for flood datasets across the entire NYC Open Data platform. This was done by searching for the keyword "flood" in all available datasets, which helps uncover hidden or less obvious resources that may not be immediately recognized as flood-related. The search process and its results are detailed in the [search.py](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-flood-data/blob/main/scripts/search.py) Python script, and the analysis is documented in the [dataset-analysis](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-flood-data/blob/main/notebooks/dataset-analysis.ipynb) notebook. The final results are stored in the [results](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-flood-data/tree/main/results) CSV file.

Here’s what the results CSV looks like:

![results](figures/results.png)
Figure xx: Screenshot of the results CSV, generated by searching for the keyword "flood" across the entire NYC Open Data platform. The "value" column contains instances of the keyword "flood," and the "count" column indicates the number of occurrences of each value.


The flood datasets are categorized into three groups for easier navigation:

- **Flood Hazard Layers:** These datasets provide direct information about areas at risk of flooding. They are essential for assessing flood risk and guiding flood mitigation and planning.
- **Flood-Related Datasets:** These datasets capture the infrastructure and features that contribute to flood management, resilience, mitigation, and urban response to flooding.
- **Unconventional Datasets Related to Flooding:** These datasets provide non-traditional but highly valuable data sources that can offer unique insights into urban flooding and resilience.

Tables summarizing the download counts and page views of the most popular datasets are presented below, followed by a comprehensive inventory of flood-related datasets available on NYC Open Data, including those identified through the "flood" search. In the Appendix, you’ll find tables detailing the number of rows per dataset that contain the keyword "flood." The full workflow for data analysis can be found in the [datasets-analysis](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-flood-data/blob/main/notebooks/dataset-analysis.ipynb) notebook.

## Flood-Related Datasets
These datasets capture the infrastructure and features that contribute to flood management, resilience, and urban response to flooding.
| Dataset | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| [Hurricane Evacuation Zones](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Hurricane-Evacuation-Zones/uihr-hn7s) | Hurricane Evacuation Zones are determined by New York City Emergency Management and represent varying threat levels of coastal flooding resulting from storm surge. Hurricane evacuation zones should not be confused with flood insurance risk zones, which are designated by FEMA and available in the form of Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). |
| [Hurricane Evacuation Centers](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Hurricane-Evacuation-Centers/p5md-weyf/about_data) | This dataset shows hurricane evacuation centers. Persons requiring shelter during a hurricane are processed at a hurricane evacuation center and then transported to a hurricane shelter. In the event of a hurricane, the status of these hurricane evacuation centers should be confirmed at www.nyc.gov or by calling 311. |
| [Hurricane Evacuation Centers (Map)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Hurricane-Evacuation-Centers-Map-/ayer-cga7) | Hurricane Evacuation Centers Map. See above. |
| [New York City's Flood Vulnerability Index](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/New-York-City-s-Flood-Vulnerability-Index/mrjc-v9pm) | The Flood Vulnerability Index (FVI) assesses the distribution of vulnerability to flooding across NYC in order to guide flood resilience policies and programs. Vulnerability contains three components: exposure to a hazard, susceptibility to harm from the exposure, and capacity to recover (Cutter et al., 2009). There are six hazard-specific FVIs, one for each of the six different flood hazard scenarios, which include current and two future storm surge scenarios and current and two future tidal flooding scenarios. Exposures vary for different types of flooding and different scenarios within each flood type. |
| [New York City's Flood Vulnerability Index Map](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/New-York-City-s-Flood-Vulnerability-Index-Map/4vym-qrg3) | The Flood Vulnerability Index (FVI) Map. See above. |
| [DEP Green Infrastructure](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/DEP-Green-Infrastructure/spjh-pz7h) | NYC Green Infrastructure Program initiatives. Green infrastructure (GI) collects stormwater from streets, sidewalks, and other hard surfaces before it can enter the sewer system or cause local flooding. The GI practice data contained in this dataset includes the location, program area, status, and type of GI. |
| [DEP Green Infrastructure (Map)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/DEP-Green-Infrastructure/h3ce-uahi) | DEP Green Infrastructure Map. See above. |
| [Citywide Outfalls](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Citywide-Outfalls/8rjn-kpsh/about_data) | Citywide Outfalls. |
| [Citywide Outfalls](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Citywide-Outfalls/b9ze-z4u4) | Citywide Outfalls Map. |
| [Citywide Catch Basins](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Citywide-Catch-Basins/2w2g-fk3i/about_data) | NYCDEP Citywide Catch Basins. Catch basins are an important part of New York City’s 7,500-mile sewer network. They are connected to underground pipes that channel stormwater from the street to one of DEP’s 14 wastewater resource recovery facilities, or directly into our surrounding waterbodies. DEP cleans and maintains over 150,000 catch basins citywide. |
| [Citywide Catch Basins (Map)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Citywide-Catch-Basins/2c5m-rke8) | Citywide Catch Basics Map. See above. |
| [Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Municipal-Separate-Storm-Sewer-System-MS4-Data/j57c-rqtq/about_data) | New York City’s Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Stormwater Management Program is a multiagency effort led by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to reduce pollution in stormwater runoff in the MS4 Area of NYC. This MS4 Map represents the known MS4 outfalls and drainage areas as of August 1, 2020 and provides additional data relevant to the MS4 Permit.

| [Building Elevation and Subgrade (BES)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Building-Elevation-and-Subgrade-BES-/bsin-59hv) | The Building Elevation and Subgrade data contains New York City building centroids derived from the Department of Building's (DOB) February 26th, 2022 building footprint dataset. Each record contains a grade and first floor measurement for each building (recorded as feet above sea-level in the NADV88 vertical datum) and indicates if subgrade space exists. DCP contracted with an external data vendor to generate a single point, or centroid, that represented the location of the center of every building recorded in the DOB dataset. The dataset excluded the footprints of small accessory buildings such as sheds. Each row within the dataset represents one building centroid, and records the X and Y coordinates of that centroid in the NAD 1983 coordinate system. |

| [1 foot Digital Elevation Model (DEM)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/1-foot-Digital-Elevation-Model-DEM-/dpc8-z3jc) | NYC 1foot Digital Elevation Model: A bare-earth, hydro-flattened, digital-elevation surface model derived from 2010 Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. Surface models are raster representations derived by interpolating the LiDAR point data to produce a seamless gridded elevation data set. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a surface model generated from the LiDAR returns that correspond to the ground with all buildings, trees and other above ground features removed. The cell values represent the elevation of the ground relative to sea level. The DEM was generated by interpolating the LiDAR ground points to create a 1 foot resolution seamless surface. Cell values correspond to the ground elevation value (feet) above sea level. A proprietary approach to surface model generation was developed that reduced spurious elevation values in areas where there were no LiDAR returns, primarily beneath buildings and over water. This was combined with a detailed manual QA/QC process, with emphasis on accurate representation of docks and bare-earth within 2000ft of the water bodies surrounding each of the five boroughs. |

| [Incidents Responded to by Fire Companies](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Incidents-Responded-to-by-Fire-Companies/tm6d-hbzd/about_data) | This dataset contains detailed information on incidents handled by FDNY Fire (non-EMS) units and includes fire, medical and non-fire emergencies. The data is collected in the New York Fire Incident Reporting System (NYFIRS), which is structured by the FDNY to provide data to the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS). NFIRS is a modular all-incident reporting system designed by the U.S. Fire Administration. After responding to an incident, FDNY officers complete one or more of the NFIRS modules, depending upon the type of incident. The information in these modules describes the kind of incident responded to, where it occurred, the resources used to mitigate it. Although NFIRS was designed specifically to understand the nature and causes of fire, as well as civilian fire casualties and firefighter injuries, it has been expanded to collect basic information on all incidents to which fire units respond. |
